This project aims to analyze coffee sales data to extract key insights, identify trends, and improve business decisions. The dataset includes transaction details, store locations, product categories, and sales performance metrics.


## Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, DAX formulas)


## Data Analysis Techniques

Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query

Creating dynamic reports using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts

Using DAX formulas for calculated fields

Implementing Slicers for interactive filtering

## Slicer Customization for better interactivity, 
slicers are customized based on:

Time-based filters (Month, Day)

Product-based filters (Category)

Location-based filters (Store Location)

Size-based filters (Product Size)


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To analyze sales performance, we focus on the following KPIs:

Total Revenue – Sum of all sales transactions

Total Transactions/Footfall  – Number of sales transactions

Best-Selling Product – The product with the highest quantity sold

Average Bill/Person  – Total revenue divided by total transactions

Average Order/Person  – Total QTY divided by total transactions

### Pareto analysis
##### Found that the 69% of Products aur generating 95% of the revenue and the next 31% of the Products are generating only 5% of the revenue.
#### Recommended Decisions
##### 1. Optimize Inventory & Focus on High-Performing Products
Prioritize stocking and promoting the 69% of products that generate 95% of revenue.
Reduce or discontinue the bottom 31% of products that contribute only 5% of revenue unless they have strategic importance (e.g., customer retention, brand image).
##### 2. Price & Promotion Strategy for Low-Performing Products
Identify whether the underperforming 31% of products have potential for improvement through discounts, bundling, or repositioning.
If they are essential for certain customers (e.g., niche demand), consider targeted marketing or loyalty programs instead of mass promotion.
##### 3. Expand the Best Sellers & Cross-Sell
Introduce variations, combos, or premium versions of the top 69% of products to maximize revenue.
Recommend best-selling products with underperforming ones to increase basket size and drive sales for low-performing items.
